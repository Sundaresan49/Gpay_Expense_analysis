üìä Project Overview
In today's digital age, managing shared expenses can be a tedious task, especially when dealing with various transactions spread across different platforms. This project aims to simplify expense tracking and sharing for Google Pay users. By processing your Google Pay transaction data, the notebook calculates and visualizes group expenses, making financial management among friends, family, or colleagues more transparent and efficient.

‚ú® Features
Expense Aggregation: Automatically aggregates expenses from your Google Pay transaction data.

Group-wise Analysis: Organizes and analyzes spending based on different groups or categories.

Individual Contribution Tracking: Helps track each member's contributions and dues within a shared expense scenario.

Data Visualization: Potentially offers visual insights into spending patterns (depending on notebook implementation details).

Simplified Expense Sharing: Facilitates a clearer understanding of who owes what, streamlining the settlement process.

üõ† Technologies Used
The core of this project is built using:

Python: For data processing and analysis.

Jupyter Notebook: Provides an interactive environment for running the analysis.

Pandas: (Likely) for data manipulation and analysis of tabular data.

Matplotlib/Seaborn: (Likely) for data visualization.

üöÄ How to Use
To use this expense analysis tool, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/Sundaresan49/Gpay_Expense_analysis.git
cd Gpay_Expense_analysis
Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Python installed. You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

Bash

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
(Note: Additional libraries might be required based on the notebook's specific imports.)

Obtain Google Pay Transaction Data:
You will need to export your Google Pay transaction history. Typically, this can be done from the Google Pay app or website by requesting your data, often available in JSON or CSV format. Ensure your data is in a format compatible with the notebook's parsing (likely JSON).

Place Your Data:
Place your exported Google Pay transaction JSON file in the same directory as the Gpay Expense Sharing.ipynb notebook, or update the notebook's code to point to the correct file path. You might need to rename your transaction file to match what the notebook expects (e.g., transactions.json).

Run the Jupyter Notebook:
Start the Jupyter Notebook server from your terminal:

Bash

jupyter notebook
This will open a browser window with the Jupyter interface. Navigate to Gpay Expense Sharing.ipynb and open it.

Execute the Notebook Cells:
Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to process your data and view the expense analysis. The notebook will guide you through the steps of loading data, performing calculations, and displaying results.
